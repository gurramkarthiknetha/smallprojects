# One-Portfolio

Welcome to One-Portfolio! This React app is a personal website that can showcase various sections about yourself. It provides information about your background, projects, experience, and includes a contact form. It features React smooth scrolling, an intuitive navbar, and a sidebar that contains social links. The app is built using React, HTML, and JavaScript, with styling implemented using Tailwind CSS.

## Features

1. **Home Page**: The home page displays an image of yourself along with a short header, giving visitors a brief introduction.

2. **About Me**: The about me section provides detailed paragraphs describing yourself, including your interests, skills, and aspirations.

3. **Portfolio**: The portfolio section showcases all the projects you have completed. It allows visitors to see the range of work you have done and provides links to the corresponding project pages or repositories. You optionally can create functionality to bring users to your projects via the buttons underneath each project.

4. **Experience**: The experience section lists the various tech stacks you have worked with, demonstrating your proficiency in different technologies, languages, and programs.

5. **Contact Me**: The contact me section enables visitors to reach out to you. It includes a contact form powered by GetForm.io, which collects and sends the messages to your desired email address.

2. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.
3. Configure the build settings for your app, specifying the build command as npm run build and the publish directory as build.
